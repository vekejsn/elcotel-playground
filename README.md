# elcotel-playground

Various scripts related to the reverse engineering of the Elcotel payphone programming files

## Usage

Both scripts are now [PEP723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) (Inline script metadata) compliant and can be easily run with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Provided uv is installed the end user no longer needs to worry about dependencies or python versions.

```bash
uv run ratefile_create.py --help
```

```bash
uv run ratefile_read.py --help
```
