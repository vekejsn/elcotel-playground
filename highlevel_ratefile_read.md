    READ the NXX table count from a known offset (e.g., offset 890)
    FOR each NXX table entry (from 1 to int_NXXCount) DO
         READ the following fields sequentially:
             - Band number or identifier
             - Pricing attributes (e.g., MC8BF, MC8CA)
             - A fixed–length (e.g., 100–character) table string
         STORE these fields in the NXX_TABLE_ARRAY (or m00FC)

    // 7. Finalize the Reading Process
    PERFORM any final adjustments or error–checks as needed
    CLOSE the file
